          In 2005 Eric took his first Tango class and fell in love immediately.
          A month later he had moved to Buenos Aires to pursue the dance full
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the years since, he has continued to explore the many unique
          avenues of style, technique, and self-expression that Argentine Tango
          offers. Eric has taught, toured, dj-ed, and performed throughout the
          US and Europe and Argentina.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eric is exceptional both for his endless willingness to refine and
          reinvent his dance as well for as for the unusual breadth of his
          knowledge and experience. In classes, Eric focuses on pursuing ease,
          presence, expression, and pleasure, as the most rewarding and direct
          ways to explore the dance.

          Mary has been dancing her entire life. Her childhood was sprinkled
          with ballet, tap, and hip hop classes and she has studied and taught
          Zumba extensively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mary first encountered Tango early in 2022 and quickly found it was a
          dance she could not live without. Tango is full of compassion and
          conversation. The musicality and improvisation of Tango allow each
          dance to feel new and exciting. But her favorite part is experiencing
          each sweet embrace and connection from different dance partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mary delights in teaching this beautiful dance and working to build
          and expand the Tucson Tango community!

          Ali started dancing in Turkey, after winning a pair of shoes in a
          random raffle at a Milonga his parents dragged him to.
        </p>
        <p>
          While his parents have been dancing for over fifteen years, Ali had
          somehow managed to avoid trying Tango until 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          After relocating to Tucson to pursue a PHD in Physics, Ali began
          taking Tango classes, became quickly infatuated, and now dances every
          chance he gets.
